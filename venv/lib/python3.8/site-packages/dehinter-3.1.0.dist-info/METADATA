## About

`dehinter` is a Python command line application that removes TrueType instruction sets, global hinting tables, and other associated OpenType table data in font files. The tool provides cross-platform support on macOS, Windows, and Linux systems with a Python v3.6+ interpreter.

## What it does

- Removes OpenType [glyf table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/glyf) instruction set bytecode data
- Removes OpenType and other TTF hinting related tables - [cvt table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cvt) - [fpgm table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/fpgm) - [hdmx table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hdmx) - [LTSH table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/ltsh) - [prep table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/prep) - [TTFA table](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/doc/ttfautohint.html#add-ttfa-info-table) (not part of the OpenType specification) - [VDMX table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/vdmx)
- Removes OpenType [cvar table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cvar) from variable fonts
- Updates [gasp table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/gasp) values
- Updates [maxp table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/maxp) values
- Updates [head table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head) bit flags
- Displays file sizes of the hinted and dehinted versions of the fonts

Options allow you to maintain the original version of any of these tables.

## Installation

`dehinter` requires a Python 3.6+ interpreter.

Installation in a [Python3 virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended as dependencies are pinned to versions that are confirmed to work with this project.

Use any of the following installation approaches:

### pip install from PyPI

```
$ pip3 install dehinter
```

### pip install from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/dehinter.git
$ cd dehinter
$ pip3 install .
```

### Developer install from source

The following approach installs the project and associated optional developer dependencies so that source changes are available without the need for re-installation.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/dehinter.git
$ cd dehinter
$ pip3 install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```
$ dehinter [OPTIONS] [HINTED FILE PATH]
```

By default, a new dehinted font build write occurs on the path `[ORIGINAL HINTED FONT NAME]-dehinted.ttf` in the `[HINTED FILE PATH]` directory.

Use `dehinter -h` to view available options.

## Issues

Please report issues on the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/source-foundry/dehinter/issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are warmly welcomed. A development dependency environment can be installed in editable mode with the developer installation documentation above.

Please use the standard Github pull request approach to propose source changes.

### Source file linting

Python source files are linted with `flake8`. See the Makefile `test-lint` target for details.

### Source file static type checks

Static type checks are performed on Python source files with `mypy` and are based on type annotations in the Python source files. See the Makefile `test-type-check` target for details.

### Testing

The project runs continuous integration testing on GitHub Actions runners with the `pytest` testing toolchain. Test modules are located in the `tests` directory of the repository.

Local testing by Python interpreter version can be performed with the following command executed from the root of the repository:

```
$ tox -e [PYTHON INTERPRETER VERSION]
```

Please see the `tox` documentation for additional details.

### Test coverage

Unit test coverage is executed with the `coverage` tool. See the Makefile `test-coverage` target for details.

## Acknowledgments

`dehinter` is built with the fantastic [fontTools free software library](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) and is based on the dehinting approach used in the [`ttfautohint` free software project](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/).
